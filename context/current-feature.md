# Current Feature: Auth Phase 4 — Email Verification on Register

## Status

In Progress

## Goals

- Install Resend and create `src/lib/resend.ts` client singleton
- On register (`/api/auth/register`): generate a UUID token, store it in the `VerificationToken` table, send a verification email via Resend with a `/verify-email?token=...` link
- Create `/api/auth/verify-email` GET route: validate token expiry, set `emailVerified` on the user, delete the token, redirect to `/login?verified=true`
- Block unverified Credentials users from signing in in `auth.ts` `authorize()` — return null with a hint so the sign-in page can display "Please verify your email first"
- Create `/verify-email` page showing "Check your inbox" after registration
- Show verification error/success feedback on the login page (reads `?verified=true` or `?error=unverified` query params)
- GitHub OAuth users skip verification (they are verified by GitHub — `emailVerified` is set by the adapter automatically)

## Notes

- Resend API key is in `.env` as `RESENT_API_KEY` (note the typo — use this exact env var name)
- `VerificationToken` model already exists in the schema (NextAuth table): `identifier`, `token`, `expires`; use `identifier = email`, `token = UUID`, `expires = now + 24h`
- `emailVerified` field already exists on `User` model
- The register route currently creates the user and returns `{ success: true }` — update it to also generate and send the verification email before returning
- Do NOT send verification emails for GitHub OAuth sign-ins; only Credentials registrations need this
- Token expiry: 24 hours
- Resend sender: `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's shared domain — swap for `noreply@devstash.io` once domain is set up)
- Keep email template simple: plain HTML with a clearly visible verify button/link
